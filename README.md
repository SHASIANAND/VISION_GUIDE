## Features <a name="features"></a>
Vision Guide offers the following features:
- **Face Recognition:** The project can recognize faces using face recognition technology.
- **Image Capture:** It allows you to capture images of people or objects.
- **Object Recognition:** Identifies objects in real-time using YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection.
- **Text-to-Speech:** Converts text to speech, helping visually impaired users understand text content.
- **Currency Recognition:** Identifies the denomination of currency notes.

## Requirements <a name="requirements"></a>
Before you start using Vision Guide, make sure you have the following requirements installed:

- Python (3.7+ recommended)
- OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library)
- SpeechRecognition
- Pyttsx3
- Face Recognition
- Tesseract-OCR
- Requests
- Numpy

You can install these requirements using `pip`, for example:
```bash
pip install opencv-python
pip install SpeechRecognition
pip install pyttsx3
pip install face-recognition
pip install pytesseract
pip install numpy
```

Additionally, you'll need to download the YOLOv4-tiny weights and configuration files and create a `dnn_model` folder with these files:
- yolov4-tiny.weights
- yolov4-tiny.cfg
- classes.txt

You can download these files from the official YOLO website.

## Installation <a name="installation"></a>
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/vision-guide.git
   cd vision-guide
   ```

2. Install the required Python packages as mentioned in the [Requirements](#requirements) section.

3. Set up Tesseract-OCR:
   - Download and install Tesseract-OCR from [here](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract).
   - Set the Tesseract-OCR executable path in your code:
     ```python
     pytesseract.pytesseract.tesseract_cmd = 'C:/Program Files/Tesseract-OCR/tesseract'
     ```

4. Create a `faces` folder in the project directory for storing face images.

5. Download the YOLOv4-tiny weights, configuration, and classes files as mentioned in the [Requirements](#requirements) section and place them in a `dnn_model` folder in the project directory.

## Usage <a name="usage"></a>
To use Vision Guide, follow these steps:

1. Run the `vision_guide.py` script:
   ```bash
   python vision_guide.py
   ```

2. The program will start listening for voice commands. Say "Alexa" followed by your command to initiate the desired functionality.

3. You can use commands like:
   - "Hello" to start the conversation.
   - "Identify" to identify faces.
   - "Take" to capture an image.
   - "Who" to recognize people.
   - "Surrounding" to identify objects in your surroundings.
   - "Read" to read text.
   - "Bill" to recognize bill details.
   - "Currency" to identify currency denominations.
   - "Exit" to exit the program.

4. Follow the program's voice prompts and enjoy the features!
